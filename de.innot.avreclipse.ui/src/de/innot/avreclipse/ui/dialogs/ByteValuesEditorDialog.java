/**
 * A Fuse Byte Editor as a Dialog.
 * <p>
 * This Dialog is called from the AVRDude Fuses Property Dialog to optionally edit fuse byte values
 * in the same fashion as the Editor for .fuses files.<br>
 * It will show all BitFields of the given ByteValues as {@link BitFieldEditorSectionPart}s for
 * editing.
 * </p>
 * To use this Dialog instantiate it with the <code>ByteValues</code> to edit and call
 * {@link #open()}. While this Dialog will only commit any modifications to the given
 * <code>ByteValues</code> if the <em>OK</em> was pressed, callers should not depend on this and
 * should discard the <code>ByteValues</code> object after the <em>Cancel</em> button has been
 * pressed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A safe access pattern could look like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     	ByteValues values = ....
 * 	   	ByteValuesEditorDialog dialog = new ByteValuesEditorDialog(getShell(), values);
 *     	dialog.create();
 *      dialog.optimizeSize();
 *  	if (dialog.open() == Dialog.OK) {
 *  		ByteValues newvalues = dialog.getByteValues();
 *  		....
 *  	}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because the <code>ColumnLayout</code> used in the Dialog has some problems when its size is not
 * constrained. It will grab to much screen space, sometimes all of it. The {@link #optimizeSize()}
 * method contains a fix to reduce the size of the dialog to the minimum required. Alternatively a
 * fixed size can be set with <code>dialog.getShell().setSize(int width, int height)</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: there is currently an unresolved bug that when the alphabetically first BitField shown is
 * of a Radio Button type and its value is undefined (<code>-1</code>) then the first radio
 * button gets set to true anyway. This is because SWT (or Windows) will set the first radio button
 * to true whenever the control gets the focus, and the first control on the screen will always get
 * the focus.
 * </p>
