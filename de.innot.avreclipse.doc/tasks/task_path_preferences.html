<h1>AVR Paths Preferences</h1>
<p>The plugin needs to know the paths to the avr-gcc toolchain and some other files on the development system. Usually these paths are included in the <em>$PATH</em> environment variable, however, especially on Linux distributions the included avr-gcc toolchain might be out of date or multiple versions of the avr-gcc toolchain might be installed.</p>
<p>The plugin tries to determine all required paths at runtime. Refer to <a href="../concepts/avr_path_management.html">AVR Plugin Path Management</a> to see how the system paths are determined.</p>
<p>If you need to change the determined defaults, e.g. because you use multiple toolchain versions or the no default could be determined, you can change the paths manually.</p>
<p class="UILabel">Select <em class="UILabel">Window &gt; Preferences...</em> and select the <EM class="UILabel">AVR &gt; Paths</em> tree item</p>
<p><img src="images/path_preference_page1.png" alt="Path Preference Page" width="716" height="364" ></p>
<p>Here all Paths are at their system default. Note that all entries are paths, even if they refer to a single file. In these cases they refer to the parent directory of the file.</p>
<p>Two different icons show warnings and errors:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/warn_tsk.gif" alt="warning" ></td>
    <td>The current path is empty and should be changed to enable an optional features of the plugin</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/error_tsk.gif" alt="error" ></td>
    <td>The current path is invalid and needs to be changed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To change a path, select it and click on the <span class="guibutton">Edit...</span> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/path_preference_page2.png" alt="Change Path Dialog"></p>
<p>The top line of the dialog has a short description of the path.</p>
<p>The Path source field is used to change the source type of the path. Three options are available:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p>System</p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><p>The path determined by the plugin. This path can not be modified</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p>Bundled</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>Select a bundled AVR GCC Toolchain</p>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>Not yet supported in the 2.3 version of the plugin      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p>Custom</p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><p>Select a custom path.</p>
    <p>Click on <span class="guibutton">Browse...</span> to select a new path. If the selected path is not valid an error message is shown.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> For optional paths an empty Custom value is possible. A warning is generated but the empty path is still valid.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>After clicking on <span class="guibutton"> OK</span>, the path settings are updated according to the changes.</p>
