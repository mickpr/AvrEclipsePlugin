/**
 * Single BitField change event.
 * <p>
 * An array of these Events is sent to registered {@link IByteValuesChangeListener}s for any
 * changes in a {@link ByteValues} object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The event has the name of the changed BitField and its new value. As a convenience it also has
 * the index and the value of the byte containing the BitField as well as a reference to the source
 * <code>ByteValues</code>.<br>
 * There are two special event defined. Instead of the name of a BitField they have the following
 * names:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ByteValues#MCU_CHANGE_EVENT}: the MCU of the source ByteValues has changed.</li>
 * <li>{@link ByteValues#COMMENT_CHANGE_EVENT}: The comment property of the source ByteValues has
 * changed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The receiver can get the actual values from the supplied <code>ByteValues</code>. In either
 * case all other parameters of the event are undefined.
 * </p>
