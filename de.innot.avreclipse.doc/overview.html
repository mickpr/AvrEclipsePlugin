<h1>AVR Eclipse Plugin Overview </h1>

<p>The AVR Eclipse Plugin is an extension to the C/C++ Development Toolkit (CDT) to develop applications for the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/products/AVR/" target="_blank">ATMEL AVR</a> series of embedded processors.</p>

<p>At its core are new toolchains that know how to build the hex dump files which can be deployed on an AVR series processor. Some additional useful tools of the GNU binutils are integrated as well. Two views are included, which show some  information about the selected target processor. </p>
<p>This plugin also supports uploading applications to a target device with the help of the external tool avrdude.</p>
<p>The Plugin requires the GNU toolchain for the AVR Target processor. Please see the <a href="concepts/before_you_begin.html">Before you begin</a> section for installation instructions. Then you can try the tutorials in the <a href="gettingstarted/gs_tutorials.html">Getting Started</a> section to get a first impression or learn about the latest features in the <a href="other/whatsnew.html">What's new</a> section.<br>
