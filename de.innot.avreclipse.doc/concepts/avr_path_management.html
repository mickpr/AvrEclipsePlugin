<h1>AVR Plugin path management</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Early versions of the AVR Eclipse Plugin (prior 2.1) relied on the system path of the development system to execute the required tools (<em>avr-gcc</em>, <em>avr-size</em>, <em>make</em> etc.)</p>
<p>This had some drawbacks. </p>
<ul>
  <li>On non-Windows platforms the avr-gcc toolchain supplied by the distributions is often out-of-date and does not contain the latest patches. Therefore many AVR developers will probable compile the avr-gcc toolchain themselves, but keep it in a separate location from the distribution supplied toolchain.</li>
  <li>On Windows the winAVR toolchain is the de-facto standard and it is usually up-to-date. But even here the user might want to install multiple versions of winAVR, for example to try out newer versions while keeping the previous version. Besides this, the winAVR installer asks if the user wants to include winAVR in the system paths, which he might decline for some reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the system path might not point to the toolchain the plugin user actually wants to use.</p>
<p>Also, as the AVR Eclipse Plugin grew in features, it required access to some specific files that are not on the system path, like the &lt;avr/io.h&gt; include file.</p>
<p>Another reason for implementing a path management was the inclusion of toolchain bundles in future versions of the plugin. A bundled toolchain will be a normal avr-gcc toolchain wrapped in a Eclipse plugin. This will allow ISV to compile an up-to-date toolchain and distribute it to users, using the Eclipse update mechanism. The user then has a fully working toolchain without needing to compile it himself.</p>
<h2>Path sources</h2>
<p>For each path the plugin requires, three different sources are possible:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>System paths</h3>
<p>This is the path as determined by the Plugin itself. The method of determining the system path is different on Windows and non-Windows machines:</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>The paths are taken from the Windows registry for the <em>winAVR</em> and <em>AVR Tools</em> applications.</p>
<h4>non-Windows</h4>
<p>The plugin currently assumes that all non-Windows platforms are Posix based. </p>
<p>Each path has a test file associated with it, which will be searched for. To find this test file the following external commands are executed in order until a successful match is found:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>which</em> command: Test if the test file is on the system $PATH</li>
  <li><em>find</em> command: if the test file is not on the system $PATH, then the plugin will start searching the following directories (and their subdirectories)  in  order:<br>  
    <table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">
      <tr>
        <td>/usr/local/</td>
        <td rowspan="3">Some likely places for the avr-gcc toolchain</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/usr/</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/opt/</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/etc/</td>
        <td>A likely place for configuration files like <em>avrdude.conf</em></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>~/</td>
        <td>The home of the current user</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/home/</td>
        <td>All other home directories</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>If all searches were unsuccessful an empty path is used.</li>
</ol>
<p>As these searches may take some time, they are performed at plugin startup and run in the background. However, if the searches have not been finished by the time the results are actually used, Eclipse will block until finished.<br>
  <br>
As this startup delay can get quite long on large development systems, it can be inhibited on the path preference page.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Bundle paths</h3>
<p>As of version 2.3 this is not yet implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Custom paths</h3>
<p>A path manually selected by the user. Each user supplied path is tested if it contains the  test file as used for determining the system paths. Only paths that contain the required test file are accepted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Optional vs. required vs. valid paths</h3>
<p>Some of the files that the AVR Plugin accesses are not required for the basic operation. The paths to these files are marked as optional and may be empty if the required files are not available on the development system. This may cause some features to not work or be disabled.</p>
<p>A path is only valid if it contains a certain required test file (or is empty in case of an optional path). See below for a list of test files</p>
<h2>Current paths</h2>
<p>As of version 2.1, the plugin manages these paths</p>
