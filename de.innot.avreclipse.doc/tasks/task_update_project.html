<h1>Update AVR projects</h1>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to break compatibility with projects created with previous versions of the plugin. This is done to include / upgrade features or to fix bugs.</p>
<p>The plugin has a project update converter to update projects created with previous versions of the plugin. Projects not converted usually do not build  anymore.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before updating a project, especially with a beta version of this Plugin, you might want to make a backup of your project.<br>
  While none of your source files are touched by the upgrade, your carefully selected toolchain options could be affected.
  </p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>To upgrade old projects right click on the project<br>
    and select <em class="UILabel">Convert To...</em> from the context menu.</td>
    <td><img src="images/convert1.png" alt="Select Convert To"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If the project has been created with a previous version and is updateable to the current version, the following dialog is shown:</p>
<p><img src="images/convert2.png" alt="Converter Dialog Box" ></p>
<p>Select <em class="UILabel">Update to AVR Eclipse x.x</em> and click <span class="guibutton">OK</span></p>
<p>The Eclipse internal informations about the project are then updated. Note that there is no visible changes other that the project builds again.<br>
Calling the converter multiple times for a project is possible and does not cause any harm.</p>
