<h1>Upload Project to Target MCU</h1>
<p>At some point in AVR project development you need to deploy your application to a real AVR processor. This is supported by the AVR Eclipse Plugin with the help of the external programm <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/" target="_blank">avrdude</a>. Avrdude stands for <u>AVR D</u>ownloader / <u>U</u>ploa<u>de</u>r and is an open source utility to upload/download and manipulate the ROM and EEPROM contents of many AVR microcontrollers using the in-system programming technique (ISP).</p>
<p>Once a project is build it can be uploaded by right-clicking on the project and then selecting <strong>AVR</strong> -&gt; <strong>Upload Project to Target Device</strong>. Alternatively an AVR project can be selected and then the upload can be started with the <img src="images/avrdl-small.gif" alt="" width="24" height="24" border="1" align="absmiddle"> toolbar button.</p>
<p>The upload is started and its progress is shown in the console view.</p>
